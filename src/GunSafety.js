        <br /> victim of gun violence yourself with no injuries? Did you
        hallucinate? I have been called ADHD for saying I cannot concentrate to
        get amphedamines (Ritalin) to work diligently. I have mimicked a kissing
        contest and took leave of absense to work on thumbprint.us, by the grace
        of a family conflicted-interest psychologist and a lawyer. These labels
        are not evidence of danger and these bills are a grave violation of
        citizens' safety, arming the government but not any angry but peaceful
        detractors. I've also been called OCD by so-called

        Sounds like the Charleston loophole can only be closed by not having
        shit tech + police dashboard for LITERAL threatening posts or creating a
        loophole for the FBI to keep guns away from people who view violence
        against themselves as including property and money/market(not-accrual,
        depositary)/vault-share and should be able to at least brandish thieves
        like the cops can to both unarmed and armed arrests
