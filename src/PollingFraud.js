        why is she allowed to lie or not be corrected, misleading people
        everywhere to their detriment

        She says race-based business are forced to shutter - that is only
        contracts subject to impossible doctrine or forced majeure. Without
        finance (counterfeit-contracts, rent-seeking colonization), these issues
        would be non-existent. Instead of attacking the source of the issue,

        Saying $1t goes to the "pockets of american people" is a grandiose lie -
        the money is due to obligations until that is reversed for improper
        waging of funds not under the ownership of the signee of the debt,
        loitering of the borrower and down-payments kept by the creditor. A
        great conspiracy to be aided by Nancy.
